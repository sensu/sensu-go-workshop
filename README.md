## Overview

The Sensu Go Workshop is a collection of learning resources designed to help new users learn Sensu.
The project includes the following resources:

1. Interactive lessons designed for self-guided learning
2. Detailed instructions for Mac, Windows, and Linux workstations
3. A local sandbox environment for use with the workshop (via Docker Compose or Vagrant)

Additional workshop materials are also available for advanced use cases, including instructor-led workshops with multi-tenant sandbox environment, and alternative sandbox environments based on popular Sensu reference architectures (e.g. Sensu w/ [InfluxDB][influxdb], [TimescaleDB][timescaledb], [Elasticsearch][elasticsearch], and [Prometheus][prometheus]).

> _NOTE: the Sensu Go Workshop is under active development, so check back often for new content and other improvements, including videos (coming Q4'21)!_

## Lessons

The Sensu Go Workshop aims to provide learning resources for every Sensu user, including:

- **Operators** and other end-users who rely on Sensu for infrastructure and application monitoring.
- **Developers** and other engineers who want to build integrations using Sensu APIs.

## Next Steps

We hope you enjoy this workshop and find it helpful for learning more about Sensu!
At this point we have covered Sensu's most common concepts, which should give you a much better sense for how Sensu works – but we've barely scratched the surface.
